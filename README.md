# What is this book about?

Developing Kaggle Notebooks is here to introduce you to the wide world of data analysis, with a focus on using Kaggle Notebooks resources to help you achieve mastery in this field as well as rising to the top in the Kaggle Notebooks tier. The book is structured as a seven-step trip into the world of analysis, exploring the features available in Kaggle Notebooks alongside various data analysis techniques and different kinds of datasets.

# What you will learn
* Approach a new dataset or competition to perform a data analysis via a Notebook and get noticed
* Start exploring a new source of data, from tools to use for ingestion to treating various issues with ingested data
* Structure your code using reusable components
* Perform a deep dive for both small and large datasets of various types
* Differentiate yourself from the crowd with the content of your analysis
* Improve the style of your Notebook: color scheme, content organization, visual effects, and theme
* Use storytelling techniques to captivate your audience, improve the clarity of the presentation, and raise its impact

# Who This Book Is for?
This book is suitable for a wide audience with a keen interest in data science and machine learning and those who want to use Kaggle Notebooks to improve their skills and rise in the Kaggle Notebooks ranks.
